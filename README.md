Yes I know there's a typo. It's deliberate. I can't seem to spell directory names correctly, so instead we're just going to roll with it.

## Roadmap

### Document Visibility Controls
Be able to share documents with your friends, and in the process, control finely what they can and can't see.
- Share a document to individual people or groups.
- Hide certain information in the document so only you or select people and groups can see it.
- Change this dynamically for each group.
- Live updates so you can share information while in the middle of a session 

### Simplistic Value Sharing
Integrate item effects, consumables, and even arbitrary values like names or stats within and across documents. 
- Calculate values dynamically when you update them within a document. 
- Share these values across your documents
- Update one place, view anywhere

### Modular Documents
Allow your documents to attach formatted sections for whatever you need, regardless of the original purpose of the document.
- Add custom sections throughout your documents.
